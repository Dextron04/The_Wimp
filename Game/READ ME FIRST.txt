Hello! People This game is not the one I was actually working on, There might be a lot of bugs in this game but still it was worth a shot, Now lets talk more about the game:
                                         This game is actually based on dungeons and dragons and just as a disclaimer I haven't written its story its completely copied from another creator so please don't come at me saying "You Cheat!" cause I am just a beginner I have the right to learn from other projects, but I can gurantee you that the next game's story will be my orignal.
